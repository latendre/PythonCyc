This is part of PythonCyc, a Python interface module to Pathway Tools.
This code has been tested with Python 2.6.

Pathway Tools (version 18.5 and up) must be running on some machine
with at least the option '-python'. It is also recommended
to start Pathway Tools with the option -lisp, so that the
connection can be monitored:

./pathway-tools -lisp -python

The global functions defined in this init file can be called before any
PGDB (an organism database in Pathway Tools) has been selected.
In fact, two of these functions, select_organism and
its synonym so, are needed to "select" a PGDB by creating a PGDB object.
See class PGDB in PGDB.py for information about how to use a PGDB object.

See the README file for more information about PythonCyc.
